# EvoGraph: An Effective and Efficient Graph Upscaling Method for Preserving Graph Properties.

## Background
Implementation of KDD '18 accepted paper, EvoGraph. This graph upscaling method paper can be found in the `Citations` section at the bottom.

Implementations of both [normal](/evograph/src/evograph.py) and [parallel computing](/evograph/src/evographParallel.py) are present.



## Algorithm

Basic Edge Attachment: non-recursive edge attachment. The paper does not use BEA, but it is present to show what the edge-attachment look like. Basic edge attachment works for a upscale by a factor of 2, as there is no recursion necessary until a scale factor of 3. 

![BEA](/evograph/images/code-images/BEA.png)

Memory-efficient Edge Attachment: recursive edge attachment. Parent edges must be in level sf=1. When a parent edge is found, but that parent edge is not in sf=1, the recursive call works backwards to call itself, until a parent edge in sf=1 is found. This MEA is the actual DETERMINE(ey) function

![MEA](/evograph/images/code-images/MEA.png)

The calculations of the parent edge is the function h1(y), shown below:
```python
# x ~ U(0, (k-1)*|E|-1)
def h1(key):
    return H(key) mod( (k-1) * |E| )
```

The calculation of the direction of the newly-attached edge is the function h2(y), shown below:
```python
# direction ~ U(0, 1)
def h2(key):
    return H(key) % 2
```

The uniform random variable hashing functions above reference H(key), which is shown below:
```python
def H(key): 
    return ((key + 13) x 7)
```

Once the parent edge and direction have been calculated using h1 and h2, we must determine the new edge to be attached. This is done, based on the calculated direction, by referencing the proper node in the current scale factor level that is aligned with the node in the initial graph. For instance, with initial graph, and level 2 graph having nodes:

``` initial graph   -> v0 v1 v2 v3 ```

``` current k graph -> v4 v5 v6 v7 ```

The reference node of v0 is v4, v1 is v5, and so on. This final calculation of the refernce nodes is the final calculation necessary in determining the edge to be attached. 


## Parallel Computation 
It is possible to multi-process the main for-loop of the algorithm. 
Why is parallel computing allowed?
* EvoGraph does not store the currently-upscaling graph in main memory
* The graph is both read and written from the same file, on disk
* Each newly added edge is read by a different thread, and placed back into the file when the parent edge calculation is finished
* Experimental results led to conclusion that ~100-110 threads is optimal
* Since the initial file can be referenced from anywhere, read at any time in the upscale, and written back into at any time, distributed, parallel computing is allowed.
* The use of locks on the file is therefore unnecessary, as any amount of instances can access the file at any time. 

Why are the writes out of order? 
* Some of the parent-edge calculations require recursion
* Earlier reads might be written back into the file later
* Out of order does not matter, as all threads read/write their own unique thread

Normal for-loop
```python
for EdgeInstance.currentNumEdges in range(EdgeInstance.initialNumEdges, maxNumEdges):
    vsvt = DETERMINE(EdgeInstance.currentNumEdges)
    WRITE(vsvt, EdgeInstance.currentNumEdges, fileToUpscale)
```

Parallelized for-loop
```python
def parallel(fileToUpscale, kValToUpscaleTo, processes):
    p = Pool(processes=processes)
    iterRange = list(range(EdgeInstance.initialNumEdges, maxNumEdges))
    p.map(EvoGraph, iterRange)
    p.close()

def EvoGraph(currentNumEdges):
    vsvt = DETERMINE(currentNumEdges)
    WRITE(vsvt, currentNumEdges, fileToUpscale)
```

## Experimental Results

We will now show our experimental results with normal computation and parallel computation on the small scale dataset shown above. Tabs on the Expected graphs are to show the newly added edges for that level.

## Running Experiments

As stated at the beginning of the README, the Implementations of both [normal](/evograph/src/evograph.py) and [parallel computing](/evograph/src/evographParallel.py) are present in this repository. The normal code is running the experiment on the small scale dataset without parallel computation.

To run the normal file, you will want to run 

`$ python /evograph/src/evograph.py`

The file takes in no arguments, and maintains state of the original file internally. Therefore, by running this file, the printouts of all upscales with be followed by a reversion of sf=1.txt back to its starting state. The exception to this is after the program has finished executing. The upscale of the initial graph to a scale factor of 128x will not be printed to the terminal. However, the file will not be reverted to its initial state. Therefore, to view the content of this file at this point, simply `$ cat /evograph/data/sf=1.txt` keeping in mind that this file has 768 edges, each holding its own line number.

To run and evaluate EvoGraph with parallelism, you will want to run 

`$ python /evograph/src/evographParallel.py`

This file will handle reversions back to the original file as well. This code will also execute our attempt at a large scale dataset upscale. The optimal threading of this dataset upscale is known anecdotally to be 100 threads, but uncommenting the other various calls to upscale will allow performance benchmarking on your own. 

We did find in our experiments that our code had issues in upscaling the large dataset provided by original authors, `/evograph/data/toy.txt`. The upscale to scale factor of 2 seemed to be taking into account the number of current edges, and incorrectly incrementing the non-referenced node by that factor. The range of the upscale's nodes to a factor of 2 should be in the range 1016-2032, as an upscale of 1016 nodes by 2 would have a maximum of 2032 nodes. The upscale seen, however, manages to keep a range of nearly 1016 nodes (10426-11442), but just shifted by a factor of ~10426 (the original number of edges in the toy.txt file). At this point, a solution to this issue is not apparent, as the small scale dataset has no issues with upscaling properly. However, I am leaving the timing information available, as it still scales to the proper number of edges, just shifted by a factor of ~10426.

Personal benchmarking results are located in the `/evograph/analysis/parallelism.xlsx` [file](/evograph/analysis/parallelism.xlsx).

Timing experimental results are shown [here](/executionScripts/timingAndExecution.txt). Running EvoGraph regularly is shown [here](/executionScripts/runningEvograph.txt)


## Evaluation Scores

EvoGraph prides itself on the maintenance of graphical structure after upscaling. Two of these eight structural qualities, in-degreee and out-degree, are analyzed briefly in the `/evograph/analysis/degreeDistribution.xlsx` [file](/evograph/analysis/degreeDistribution.xlsx) for upscales to 2 and 3 scale factor.
